# Implement a design from scratch

## Project Overview

This project involves building a fully functional web page from scratch without using any external libraries or frameworks. The objective is to replicate the provided designer file as accurately as possible using core front-end development skills.

The implementation should make use of the following:

- Semantic HTML for proper structure

- Custom CSS for styling and layout

- Accessibility best practices

- Responsive design techniques for multiple screen sizes and devices

There are no strict step-by-step instructions. The project encourages independent decision-making and the practical application of HTML, CSS, and responsive design knowledge. The final result should visually and functionally match the given design.
